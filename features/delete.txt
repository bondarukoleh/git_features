DELETE
Difference between -d and -D - is
-d needed when you've already megre featureBranch with develop - and you don't want it since since 
TOP of feature branch is now in develop.
But if featureBranch - is not merged yet, and it's a risky operation - git won't let you to do it. 
Because commits from deleted branch - will be unreachable. But if you still want to do it -D.
If you want to revert deletion - in short time it's posible, you can recreate a branch with HEAD
pointing on that commit that you want from deleted branch
$>git checkout -b featureBranch 123d
