RERERE (Reuse recorder resolution)
So if you were making rebase or merge, or you want to rebase previously merged branch - and you stop rebasing or merging
to make something nore important - you will resolve conflicts once again. If you don't want to do that, rerere will help
$>git config rerere.enabled true
$>\some\path\to\script\rerere-train.sh --all (all conflicts from all branches)
(we need to teach rerere how we resolved conflicts in past, needed only if rerere was disabled)
$>git merge master (somple merge, with conflict that you resolved)
$>git add/commit (rerere remembered resolved conflicts)
$>git reset --hard @~
$>git merge master (without conflict)

To make rerere deleted remembered changes
$>git checkout --merge fileWithReolvedConflicts.js
$>git rerere forget fileWithReolvedConflicts.js
resolve conflict in new vay
$>git add/commit (rerere remembered resolved conflicts by new vay)
rerere will also apply resolved conflicts for rebase.

All information about rerere stored in .git/rr-cache. We can make rerere to forget about everything just by
removing this directory.
