DIFF
$>git diff 3jo3i 64ml5 (or develop feature, or develop..feature)
It will show diff blocks, hangs, that will show difference between two branches:
diff --git a/gitInfo.txt b/gitInfo.txt (showing that develop branch is - a, and feature is b)
index 56cb5e6..779c279 100644 (hash sum of gitInfo.txt in develop is 56cb5e6, in feature - 779c279,
   100644 - file type, 100 - regular file, 644 - not executable);
--- a/gitInfo.txt (name file, if it's not deleted, renamed, or changed somehow)
+++ b/gitInfo.txt
@@ -1,56 +1,44 @@ hang headre(sometimes it's here) (If in develop you'll change, as it shows in termminal,
from 1st row, 56th rows - you'll get file that you've got in feature and it will be from 1st row till 44th row.)

$>git diff develop...feature
Will compare what was changed in feature from commit that it was branched from develop.
Means it will compare commit where feature was born with TOP of feature.

$>git diff fk4g (HEAD for example)
Will show difference between current working directory changes wih commit.
git diff - defferent with git diff HEAD, without argument - it will show diff with cyrrent index, not commit.
Be aware that these types of commands - ignore untracked files.

$>git diff --cached/--staged HEAD
Show difference beetwen index and HEAD. Useful to see what we will commit after we add changes in index.

$>git diff (nothing - to compare with index, HEAD to compare with head) file.js
$> git diff develop feature file.js (you can add a few files here to save time)
Show changes of some particular file, depending on what you want to see.

$>git diff --name-only e24412
show only files that changed, after that you can look more detailed for file you're interested in.

$>git diff master:file1.js develop:file2.js
compare two different files from two different commits.

$>git diff --no-index file1.js file2.js
compare any two files on machine, no matter what it is, and in our repository or not.

$>git diff --word-diff (--color-words - will show only words without brackets stuff)
compare sentenses, with comfortable, clear difference.

Also you can exend local git config .git/config - with new diff features. i.e. add markdown
hendler (driver) in diff.
[diff "markdown"]
        # POSIX extended
        xfuncname = "^#+[[:space:]]+.+$" (it's for deff header, just a tip to diff be more readable)
        wordRegex = "\\*+|[^[:space:]*]+" (for word, how git will understand that this is a word)
and now you can add a *.md diff=markdown in your .gitattributes.

Also you can setup diff for images, and other non text files. 
For that you can use non-git utilites, and set them to config file
[diff "myOwnDiffTool"]
      command = sh -c 'icdiff "$1" "$4"'
and in gitattributes *.png diff = myOwnDiffTool
Means, that when I will call diff on png file, git will pass arguments (path to diff files,
commits, hashsum and others) to icdiff tool, but we want to have only pathes to files, thats
why we pass to icdiff first and forth arguments.
