FETCH

Fetching a branch - it's getting last branch state from remote repository.
It only downloads new data from a remote repository - but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into
your working copy of remote branch. Fetch will never manipulate, destroy, or screw up anything.
This means you can never fetch often enough.

As far as I get - fetch downloads repository/branch in some remote folder, and dont mess with your local changes of
this branch. What you'll do with it - it's up to you.

Means that if you've pulled feature branch, made a commit, and someone has committed in feature after that,
you can fetch branch, and TOP of feature branch will be on last guy commit, but HEAD will be on your commit.
So you can either merge your changes with new TOP, or just check it out.

feature$>git pull origin = git fetch origin + git merge origin/feature
