FETCH

Fetching a branch - it's getting last branch state from remote repository to .git/refs/remotes/origin/branch_name.
It only downloads latest branch state from a remote repository - but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into
your working copy of remote branch (because yours in .git/refs/heads/branch_name). Fetch will never manipulate,
destroy, or screw up anything. This means you can never fetch often enough.

Fetch downloads repository/branch in some refs folder, and dont mess with your local changes of
this branch. What you'll do with it - it's up to you.

branch_name$>git pull origin = git fetch origin + git merge origin/branch_name
