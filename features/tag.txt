TAG
Simple tags:
We can mark a commit with a tag. It's simple marker of commit, nothing more, cool thing about tag - is
that it's not moving anywhere. It's like a fact.  
$>git tag release_0.0.1 release_commit

And we can create a branch using tag (link to some commit)
$>git checkout -b fix_release_0.0.1 release_0.0.1
delete tag
$> git tag -d release_0.0.1

Tags has a lot of filter flags.
Tags with annotation, different from simple - contain information message, date, author.
#>git tag -a some_info_tag 463hki (or git tag -a -m 'It is a short message about this tag'
some_info_tag 463hki)

to check the message, we can
$>git show some_info_tag

With git describe - we cat check the nearest tag of the commit.
$>git describe release_commit (will show release_0.0.1 tag)

$>git describe HEAD
info_tag-2-g461dc07 (says that nearest tag is info_tag, we are 2 commit ahead of it,
and commit where we are)

With git archive we cat do archive from some commit. And also we can use tag here.
$>git archive some_info_tag
$>git archive -o ./temp/info_tag-2-g461dc07.zip some_info_tag (-o where to make an archive)

to unzip
$>unzip ./temp/info_tag-2-g461dc07.zip
