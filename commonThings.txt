There are 3 major states in git
Working directory - where your unindex changes are
Index - where your changes added to index
Repository - commited changes to repository.

WORKING WITH FILES
#To update file in index avoid OS
$>git update-index --chmod=+x <file>

#Or if file isn't in index yet
$>git add --chmod=+x <file>

#to add file avoid .gitignore (force)
$>git add -f .idea/../someNeededFile

#to rename
$>git mv file1 file2

CLEAN
For deleting not tracked files and directories. If you have some generated stuff or downloaded
- it will help you.
$>git clean -dxf (d - for directories) (x - for files even in gitignore) (f - to make it work)

So for cleanup whole project we need to reset hard on HEAD, and make clean -dxf
