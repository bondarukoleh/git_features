#Cchery pick - to get some commit from branch and merge it with other branch 

#branch - it's just a link to some commit. You can check it in .git/refs/heads/
# git branch -v shows the commit on what commit branch is looking

#.git/refs/HEAD - current branch

After you done a coomit - it contains information about previous commit, 
on the base of it was created, and HEAD link points on new commit.
Commit that HEAD is pointing to - called TOP of hte branch.

Commits that lead to the state of current branch - belongs to branch.
For example in maser we have 3 commits, than we checkout to feature and 
made 2 commits more. all 5 commits belongs to feature branch, since thay lead
to it state, and 3 commits belongs to master branch.
