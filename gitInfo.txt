#To update file in index avoid OS
git update-index --chmod=+x <file>

#Or if file isn't in index yet
git add --chmod=+x <file>

#to add file avoid .gitignore (force)
git add -f .idea/../someNeededFile

#To see the commit
git show <commitID>
#Current commit
git show --pretty=fuller

#To set athor of commit. You will be commiter but code author - can be some one else
git commit --author='John Snow <johnSnow@gmail.com>' --date='...' 

#to discard changes from index
git reset HEAD .idea

Remove file from index:
git reset ./someFile.js

#to add some code from file
git add -p <file>

#To commit with add, BUT This won't work with untracked (not in index) files.  
git commit -am 'message'

#Commit specific file, file, directories.
git commit -m 'message' <file/files/dir>

#git add . -> adds only current directory
#git add -A -> no matter where are you, adding all from root. 

#To remove directory, automaticly git will add this change to index
git rm -r dirtoDelete

#to remove drom index - but make untracked
git rm -r --cached file/dirToRemoveFromChach

#to rename
git mv file1 file2

#Cchery pick - to get some commit from branch and merge it with other branch 

#branch - it's just a link to some commit. You can check it in .git/refs/heads/
# git branch -v shows the commit on what commit branch is looking

#.git/refs/HEAD - current branch

After you done a commit - it contains information about previous commits on the base of it was created,
and HEAD link points on last commit. Last commit in branch - called TOP of the branch.
So important thing - 
TOP - is the last commit in branch, branch is pointing on that commit.
HEAD - is where you are, and in most cases - HEAD is pointing on the last commit in branch - so 
it's automaticly pointing on TOP of hte branch. But if you set the HEAD to point to some other commit - 
HEAD won't be pointing on the TOP of the branch.

Commits that lead to the state of current branch - belongs to branch.
For example in maser we have 3 commits, than we checkout to feature and 
made 2 commits more. all 5 commits belongs to feature branch, since thay lead
to it state, and 3 commits belongs to master branch.

#will delete all uncommited changes
git checkout -f branch 

#will checkout on commit that HEAD refers, means return the branch in latest commit's state
#Even that was added to index
git co -f HEAD (or git co -f, if the branch isn't set - will grab current branch HEAD)

#stashes all changes
git stash

#apply changes on current branch (no matter that you stashed changes in other branch)
git stash pop

Checkout will be forbitten only if git should replace some changes from branchA in branchB, 
if co could be done without any changes - it will be done.
Also If you on develop and realise thet changes should have separate branch -  
it's not a problem to create separate branch by git co -b newBranch.
TOP of develop branch and HEAD of newBranch is pointing on the same commit - so the branches are same,
but you have now all changes in newBranch, and you can easily continue.

Situation. You've done a 2b, 3c, 4d commits in develop, and realise that they should be in separate
branch. One of ways to solve this:
Create and checkout to a branch where you want these commits to be:
1. git checkout -b extraCommits (now these commits in two branches develop and extraCommits);
Recreate a develop branch with TOP on commit before you made a 1a, 2b, 3c commits:
2. git branch -f develop 1a (force needed because git won't let you to create existing branch)
That's all, now branch extraCommits has 2b, 3c, 4d commits, and develop is on 1a commit.
If you change your mind - you can set develop back
git branch -f develop extraCommits (instead 4d commit, you can set a branch name,
it will set TOP of develop to the commit that extraCommits' HEAD is pointing to)

Same stuff we can do with checkout.
1. git checkout -b extraCommits
2. git checkout -B develop 1a (-B - for existing branch, it will set last commit for develop to 1a);

Detached HEAD.
You can switch to any commit that you like
git co 3c
But be aware that this is state of detached HEAD, means you are not in branch
your HEAD is pointing on commit, not on branch's TOP. And if you will do a commit in this state - it will be
nowhere, if you like to continue working from this state - you can create a new branch for this
commit.
git cob/branch branchFromDetached
Or if you've made detached commit 3c-detached, you can cherry-pick it to your branch, it takes this commit and 
move it to your branch.

To co some file from previos commit - in current branch
git co 1mj3n4 neededFileFromPreviosCommit.

When you pass a commit id / or branch name (with is equal to commit branch TOP pointing to)
and pass a file name/directory/few files name - git doesn't switch a branch, it returns a file
to state of that commit.

If you want to switch file back to current directory state
git co HEAD neededFileFromPreviosCommit // returns file from repository to index and working directory (current branch)
or git co neededFileFromPreviosCommit // returns from index to working directory

if folder named develop and you want to revert it to current state, you need to add --
git co -- develop (everything after -- counts as a path, not branch)
